main takeaway from this one: don't forget the equal sign in <%= when you need something to show up, dummy!!!!!
Also, make sure to always use <%= %> when on view pages, and use interpolation #{} when you're creating dynamic routes in your controller!

This is a great lab to walk through the MVC (+ db) to really get this process under your skin.
